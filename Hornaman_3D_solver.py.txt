# Class 23/24 Exercises
# Q1 part a
# Since we have 7 points now to consider, we will need 6 terms for phi_new

# Q1 part b
# It takes a lot longer to do the iterations for N = 100 instead of N = 30

# Q1 part c
# Changing the convergence criterion will change what max delta needs to be reached
# in order for the iterations to stop.

# Q1 part d
# In the 2D case, the boundary conditions are being preserved in the (x, y) plane,
# while, in the 3D case, the boundary condiions are being preserved in the z axis

# Q2: part a
# np.roll is used to shift array elements along a given axis

# Q2: part b
